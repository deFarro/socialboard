# Socialboard
### Dashboard for social activities

Application to compare activity of several accounts in various social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).

Back-end is mocked now (not getting actual figures from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram). To check functionality just enter any IDs in range 1-20 digits, server will generate user and populate it with fake figures.

Back-end is in a separate repository: https://github.com/deFarro/socialboard_backend

Modular CSS (SASS) approach used for styling with Webpack.
